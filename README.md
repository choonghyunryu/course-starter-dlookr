This course approaches data diagnosis, EDA, transformation learning using:

- the [dlookr](https://choonghyunryu.github.io/dlookr/)

The interactive course site is built on the amazing framework created by [Ines Montani](https://ines.io/), originally built for her [spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io).  The front-end is powered by
[Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and the back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org).

To learn more about building a course on this framework, see Ines's starter repos for making courses in [Python](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python) and [R](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r), and her explanation of how the framework works at [the original course repo](https://github.com/ines/spacy-course#-faq).
